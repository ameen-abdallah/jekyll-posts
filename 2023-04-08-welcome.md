Hello everyone,

My name is Ameen and i am a software engineer.

This is my new small place on the web, where i will be posting about all kind of things, but i guess mostly about tech in one way or another.

I have been wanting to create a home lab for some time, both for the fun of it, for learning and for automating all kind of things in my home, so i expect to have a lot of posts on that.

This site is by the way self hosted on a Raspberry Pi.

I will also be using this site to have all kind of cheat sheets and documents that i use, but never seems to find them on the net easily.

So all in all i am hoping it will be fun, with lots of fun projects.

Thats all for now, see you :)
